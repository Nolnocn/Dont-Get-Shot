# Don't Get Shot Web

This is the full web version of Don't Get Shot. I created in my free time as I learned JavaScript by taking the original C++ code and translating the functions into JavaScript syntax. It was a fun little exercise to see the similarities and differences between the languages.

I ended up adding a few more bells and whistles to this version of the game, such as scoring and extra enemy types, to make it a more engaging and a "complete" experience.

# Don't Get Shot C++

This is the source code for the original version of Don't Get Shot, programmed in C++ and using OpenGL for rendering. I created it as my final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms course during my second year at RIT. It was the first time I attempted to create a game using C++ and I programmed the entire game in about a week. Looking back, there are a lot of little mistakes and things that could have been improved, but we all have to start somewhere.

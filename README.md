# Don't Get Shot

Don't Get Shot was essentially the project that I worked on to learn both C++ and JavaScript. It's a fairly simple game, but features some functionality that is useful to learn in any language such as mouse input, rotating and moving towards a position, and utilizing delta time rather than frames for delays.
